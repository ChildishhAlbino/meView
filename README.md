### meView provides a seamless viewing experience for both images **and** videos. It also supports viewing those files from within zip archives.

# What does meView do?
Viewers like IrfanView or Honeyview are nice and fast for viewing images and even various archives (zi√º, cbz, etc), but lack support for video formats like .webm and .mp4. Those video formats are often used to replace animated gifs.

meView was made to bring you a seamless viewing experience for images and videos. Want to browse your locally saved collection of [HighQualityGifs](https://reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs) and [AdviceAnimals](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/) in one application? No problem, meView got you!

MeView is build on the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework and thus supports all image and video formats that Chromium supports.

# Features
* Seamless viewing of images and videos
* Many supported filetypes. If Chrome can view it, so can meView (probably)
* .zip support
  * e.g zipped albums from imgur
* Video: play, pause, fast forward, rewind, autoplay, mute


* *Windows only*: Context menu entry for your Windows Explorer to easily open a folder in meView.


# Downloads
Grab the archive for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/RoyalBingBong/meView/releases), unzip it wherever you want and run meView.

# Developers
For the developers who want to tinker with the code:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RoyalBingBong/meView/`
2. Run `npm install`. It will install the dev-dependencies and after that the app's dependencies into `app/node_modules`. If that does not happen, then just install them manually via `cd app/ && npm install` and go back `cd ..`
3. Run either `npm run babel` or `npm run babel:w` (will watch the `src` folder for changes, very convenient)
4. Start the app:
    * Without dev-tools: `npm start` or `npm run start:asar` (to see how the app behaves when packaged).
    * With dev-tools: via  I have also a launch configuration for [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
