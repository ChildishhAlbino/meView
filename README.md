### meView provides a seamless viewing experience for both images **and** videos. It also supports viewing those files from within zip archives.

# What does meView do?
Viewers like IrfanView or Honeyview are nice and fast for viewing images and even various archives (zi√º, cbz, etc), but lack support for video formats like .webm and .mp4. Those video formats are often used to replace animated gifs.

meView was made to bring you a seamless viewing experience for images and videos. Want to browse your collection of [HighQualityGifs](https://reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs) and rare Pepes in one application? No problem, meView got you!

MeView is build on the [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) framework and thus supports all image and video formats that Chromium supports.

# Features
* Seamless viewing of images and videos
* Many supported filetypes. If Chrome can view it, so can meView (probably)
* .zip archive support
  * Downloaded a zipped album from imgur? Got you again.
* Video: play, pause, fast forward, rewind, autoplay, mute


* *Windows only*: Context menu entry for your Windows Explorer to easily open a folder in meView


# Downloads
Grab the archive for your OS from the [releases](https://github.com/RoyalBingBong/meView/releases), unzip it wherever you want and run meView.
