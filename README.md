# meView
Image Viewer that also allows playback of webm and mp4.

# Motivation
I got a little bit annoyed that image viewers like IrfanView or Honeyview are not
able to display short videos natively. I know that they are intended only for *images*, but
webm is essentially replacing animated gifs on the web, and being able to view those
in my default image viewer would be a realy nice qol change. Thus I sat down and hacked
together this abomination of a program.

# Supported Formats
If your Google Chrome can show it, so can meView!
